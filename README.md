Transit Photometry Based N Body Simulator

This is a Transit-Photometry Based N-Body Simulator. Using NASA's Exoplanet Archive, you can input a planet and its orbital parameters and then input transmission values for certain wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. This second part is used to map the transit curve of the planet. Note that this simulator is limited to planets only discovered by transit and those with no eccentricity in their orbits.
